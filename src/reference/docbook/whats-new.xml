	<title>What's new in Spring Integration 3.0?</title>
	<para>
		This chapter provides an overview of the new features and improvements
		that have been introduced with Spring Integration 3.0 If you are interested
		in even more detail, please take a look at the Issue Tracker tickets that
		were resolved as part of the 3.0 development process.

		<section id="3.0-tcp-events">
			<title>TCP/IP Connection Events and Connection Management</title>
			<para>
				The (supplied) <classname>TcpConnection</classname>s now emit
				<interfacename>ApplicationEvent</interfacename>s (specifically
				<classname>TcpConnectionEvent</classname>s) when connections are
				opened, closed, or an exception occurs. This allows applications
				to be informed of changes to TCP connections using the normal
				Spring <interfacename>ApplicationListener</interfacename>
				mechanism.
			</para>
			<para>
				<classname>AbstractTcpConnection</classname> has been renamed
				<classname>TcpConnectionSupport</classname>; custom connections that
				are subclasses of this class, can use its methods to publish events.
				Similarly, <classname>AbstractTcpConnectionInterceptor</classname> has
				been renamed to <classname>TcpConnectionInterceptorSupport</classname>.
			</para>
			<para>
				In addition, a new <code>&lt;int-ip:tcp-connection-event-inbound-channel-adapter/&gt;</code>
				is provided; by default, this adapter sends all <classname>TcpConnectionEvent</classname>s
				to a <interfacename>Channel</interfacename>.
			</para>
			<para>
				Further, the TCP Connection Factories, now provide a new method
				<code>getOpenConnectionIds()</code>, which returns a list of identifiers for all
				open connections; this allows applications, for example, to broadcast to all
				open connections.
			</para>
			<para>
				Finally, the connection factories also provide a new method
				<code>closeConnection(String connectionId)</code> which allows applications
				to explicitly close a connection using its ID.
			</para>

		<section id="3.0-corr-endpoint-empty-groups">
			<title>Aggregator 'empty-group-min-timeout' property</title>
				<para><classname>AbstractCorrelatingMessageHandler</classname> provides a new property
					<code>empty-group-min-timeout</code>
					to allow empty group expiry to run on a longer schedule than expiring partial groups. Empty groups will
					not be removed from the <interfacename>MessageStore</interfacename> until they have not been modified
					for at least this number of milliseconds. For more information see <xref linkend="aggregator-config"/>.
				</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-o-t-s-t">
			<title>ObjectToStringTransformer Improvements</title>
			<para>
				This transformer now correctly transforms <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>
				payloads to <classname>String</classname>. For more information see <xref linkend="transformer"/>.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-ws-outbound-uri-substitution">
			<title>Web Service Outbound URI Configuration</title>
			<para>
				Web Service Outbound Gateway 'uri' attribute now supports <code>&lt;uri-variable/&gt;</code> substitution for all
				URI-schemes supported by Spring Web Services. For more information see <xref linkend="outbound-uri"/>.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-xFTP-gw">
			<title>(S)FTP(S) Gateways</title>
			<para>
				The gateways now support the <code>mv</code> command, enabling the renaming of remote
				files.
